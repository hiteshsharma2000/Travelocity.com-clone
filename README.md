### About Project

> I recently created a replica of Travelocity.com using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project not only mimics the visually appealing design of the original website but also incorporates a seamless sign-in functionality. Users can now enjoy the convenience of logging into their accounts, providing a personalized experience and access to exclusive features. The use of React ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface, making navigation smooth and enjoyable.
